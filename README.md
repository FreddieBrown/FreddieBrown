# About Me!

I'm Freddie Brown and I'm a 4th Year CS Student at the University of Warwick. I am currently working on a lot of Rust projects such as [stabilize](https://github.com/FreddieBrown/stabilize). If you are interested in collaborating, clone the repo and make a PR! My main interests centre around Distributed Systems and P2P networks and how these can be applied to other areas, such as Machine Learning and other real world use cases.

Outside of work I am the VP of Warwick University Rugby League (always looking for new sponsors!). I support Chelsea FC and Bedford Blues RFC.

## Projects

- [stabilize](https://github.com/FreddieBrown/stabilize): This is a load balancer written in Rust using the QUIC protocol.
- [Bluefind](https://github.com/FreddieBrown/Bluefind): My dissertation project which investigated the use of P2P dissemintation of location dat using Bluetooth. Mark: 84%.
- [rello](https://github.com/FreddieBrown/rello): Command Line Project Management Tool. Allows users to create and use a Kanban board within a Git repo.

- ***MastersAvenue*** (2018) *Summer Intern*: Built auction platform using to match students to Universities/agents for PG study

## Technologies

- ***Languages***: Rust, C/C++, Java, Python, SQL, Verilog, JavaScript, PHP

## Interesting Things

- [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html): A language I am using a lot at the moment, the Rust Book is a great place to start!
- [Quinn](https://github.com/djc/quinn): Library I used for stabilize. Works well and integrates with tokio nicely
- [Red Notice](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Red-Notice-Became-Putins-Enemy/dp/0593072952): This is a book that I enjoyed and think it provides an interesting insight into Russian politics and business.
- [American Kingpin](https://www.amazon.co.uk/American-Kingpin-Criminal-MasterMind-Behind/dp/1591848148): Book about the drugs on the dark web and how they caugh the people running it
- [Ready Player One](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ready-Player-One-Ernest-Cline/dp/0099560437/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3FNQPSIKYWPHI&dchild=1&keywords=ready+player+one&qid=1594480135&s=books&sprefix=ready%2Cstripbooks%2C171&sr=1-1): Brilliant book about a dystopian future centred around VR, sequel coming soon.
- [How Swift Achieved Dynamic Linking Where Rust Couldn't](https://gankra.github.io/blah/swift-abi/): Interesting article about ABIs and how Swift has acheived it and the problems Rust has in implementing one for itself.
