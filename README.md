# About Me!

I'm Freddie Brown and I'm a CS Graduate from the University of Warwick. I am currently working on Rust projects such as [stabilize](https://github.com/FreddieBrown/stabilize). If you are interested in collaborating, clone the repo and make a PR! My main interests centre around Distributed Systems and P2P networks and how these can be applied to other areas, such as Machine Learning and other real world use cases.

## Projects

- [LukChain](https://github.com/FreddieBrown/LukChain): Generalised Blockchain library
- [Sybl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DveGa9gjLDo&t=1149s): Low-code Ensemble ML Platform making data science simple.
- [stabilize](https://github.com/FreddieBrown/stabilize): This is a load balancer written in Rust using the QUIC protocol.
- [Bluefind](https://github.com/FreddieBrown/Bluefind): Dissertation project which investigated the use of P2P dissemintation of location dat using Bluetooth.
